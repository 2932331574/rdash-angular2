# Introduction

[AngularJS 2](https://angular.io/) implementation of the [RDash admin dashboard](http://rdash.github.io) theme

**Note:** Angular 2.0 is not production ready yet! This seed project is perfect for playing around with the latest versions but do not start new projects with it since a lot of new changes are going to be introduced until the framework is officially released.

# How to start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ziyasal/rdash-angular2.git
cd rdash-angular2
npm install

```
_Does not rely on any global dependencies._
